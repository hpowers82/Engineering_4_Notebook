This repository will actually serve as a aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.

I didn't ask you to document hello_world.py or dice_roller.py. I'll start off with an example for dice_roller.py, and then you will reflect on calculator.py.

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

** Don't forget to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** before you upload to Github!

## Python_Dice_Roller

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Wiring

N/A

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a programn that can automatically calculate several numbers from two inputs. This program should accomplish this through a function.

### Reflection
This assignment was very helpful in showing me how to use and define functions. It also showed me how to create better print commands.

## Quadratic Calculator

### Assignment Description

The goal of this assignement is to calculate the roots of a function by inputting the values of a, b, and c for y=ax^2+bx+c.

## Wiring

### Reflection

This assignment tested my knowledge of quadratics, it was actaully a pretty good refresher for my math class lol. The elif command is a very useful thing i learned while doing this.

## Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description

The goal of the strings and loops assignments was to teach me how to use for loops and edit strings and lists.

### Reflection

The strings and loops assignment was very usefull, especially concidering the MSP assignment. 

## MSP

## Assignment Description

The goal of the MSP assignment was to create a full game of hangman within python. every time you made a mistake, a part should be added to the hangman. Every time you correctly guess a letter, it should add that letter to the correct spots in an array with letters you have not guessed yet as blanks.

### Reflection

The MSP assignment was incredibly difficult. I actually completely started over because my code had become so conveluted and unable to be understood. One thing that helped a lot was Wills code for changing the letters in the blanks array: you can find that [here](https://github.com/willhk10/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/PerfectHangman.py#L72)
